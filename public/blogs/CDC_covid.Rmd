# CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I used `vroom` to load it and kept `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()


```

Our first investigation is on co-morbidities. Let us clean the dataset a bit by deleting rows with Missing/Unknown in our desired columns. Then we could calculate death rate of people with/without co-morbidities according to their age.
```{r covid_challenge_1}
covid_data_deathrate1 <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(!(death_yn %in%c("Missing","Unknown")),
         !(medcond_yn %in%c("Missing","Unknown")),
         !(is.na(age_group)), 
         !(age_group %in%c("Missing","Unknown")),
         !(is.na(sex)), 
         !(sex %in%c("Missing","Unknown"))) %>% 
  
 group_by (age_group, sex, medcond_yn, death_yn) %>%
  count(death_yn)  %>%
  group_by (age_group, sex, medcond_yn) %>%
  mutate(death_rate = n*100/sum(n)) %>% 
  filter(death_yn=="Yes") %>% mutate(comorb = ifelse(medcond_yn=="No","Without Comorbidities","With Comorbidities"), death_rate = round(death_rate,1))

covid_data_deathrate1
```

Now it's time to plot!

```{r covid_plot_1}
covid_data_deathrate1 %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x= age_group, y = death_rate))+
  geom_col(fill="#8b9dc3")+coord_flip()+facet_grid(col=vars(sex),row=vars(comorb))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30)) +geom_text(aes(label=death_rate), position=position_dodge(width=0.9),hjust = -0.25)  + theme_bw()+
    labs(title="Covid death % by age group, sex and presence of co-morbidities",
       x="",y="", caption="Source:CDC")
```



Then, we would like to shift the focus to admittance to ICU. Similarly, we should first clean the dataset, just that instead of co-morbidities, we have to filter and mutate in accordance to admittance to ICU.

```{r covid_challenge_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
covid_data_deathrate2 <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(!(death_yn %in%c("Missing","Unknown")),
         !(icu_yn %in%c("Missing","Unknown")),
         !(is.na(age_group)), 
         !(age_group %in%c("Missing","Unknown")),
         !(is.na(sex)), 
         !(sex %in%c("Missing","Unknown"))) %>% 
  
 group_by (age_group, sex, icu_yn, death_yn) %>%
  count(death_yn)  %>%
  group_by (age_group, sex, icu_yn) %>%
  mutate(death_rate = n*100/sum(n)) %>% 
  filter(death_yn=="Yes") %>% mutate(ICU = ifelse(icu_yn=="Yes","Admitted to ICU","No ICU"), death_rate = round(death_rate,1))
```

```{r  covid_plot_2}
covid_data_deathrate2 %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x= age_group, y = death_rate))+
  geom_col(fill="#ff9966")+coord_flip()+facet_grid(col=vars(sex),row=vars(ICU))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30)) +geom_text(aes(label=death_rate), position=position_dodge(width=0.9),hjust = -0.25)+ ggtitle("Covid death % by age group, sex and whether patient was admitted to ICU")+ theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Covid death % by age group, sex and whether patient was admitted to ICU",
       x="",y="", caption="Source:CDC")

```


Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understand-- imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!
